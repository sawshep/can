# can

A command line implementation of the [Freedesktop XDG trash
specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/trash-spec/trashspec-latest.html).

Can seeks to follow the behavior of the GNOME Files
(Nautilus) trash implementation.

As of now, it is partially implemented. You can use Can on
multiple files---it will create an info file for each and
move each to the trash directory.
